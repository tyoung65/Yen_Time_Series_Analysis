# Yen_Time_Series_Analysis

This is a comparison between regression analysis and time series analysis.

The regression analysis is is able to predict the trends of the acutal returns, but with a delay. Once the actual returns begin to trend up or down, the model is able to follow the direction of the returns, but only after if recieves data to alert the model of the new trend forming. 

Using time series analysis we are able to forecast the volatility in Yen prices and use this for potential trading opportunities.
